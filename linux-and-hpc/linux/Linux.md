üêß Linux is an **open-source**, Unix-like operating **system kernel**, first released by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991.

Personally, Linux is great for servers but bad for desktops. It lacks a lot of software: Acrobat, Office, and official cloud drive clients. You can find alternatives. But they are not as good as the original one.

## Common Distros

- Large Servers or Clusters prefer Red Hat for its security and long-term support.
- For personal use, choose whatever you want. (Ubuntu for beginner)

| Distro     | Based on | Package Manager | Use Case             |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Debian     |          | `apt`           | Server, IoT          |
| [[Ubuntu]] | Debian   | `apt`           | Server, IoT, Desktop |
| **RedHat** | Fedora   | `dnf`           | Server               |
| Rocky      | RedHat   | `dnf`           | Server               |
| Arch       |          | `pacman`        | Desktop              |
| openSUSE   | SUSE     | `zypper`        | Server, Desktop      |

## Linux as a Server

To use Linux server, you need to know:
- [[SSH]]
- [[Common Linux Commands]]
- [[Linux Permissions]]
- [[Environment Variables]]

You may need to know:
- [[bashrc vs bash_profile]]
- [[Bash Script]]
- [[Symbolic Link]] (symlink)

Other Tips:
- [[stdin stdout stderr]]
