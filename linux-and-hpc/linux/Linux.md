üêß Linux is an **open-source**, Unix-like operating **system kernel**, first released by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991.

Personally, Linux is great for servers but bad for desktops. It lacks a lot of software: Acrobat, Office, and official cloud drive clients. You can find alternatives. But they are not as good as the original one.

## Common Distros

- Large Servers or Clusters prefer Red Hat for its security and long-term support.
- For personal use, choose whatever you want. (Ubuntu for beginner)

| Distro     | Based on | Package Manager | Use Case             |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Debian     |          | `apt`           | Server, IoT          |
| **Ubuntu** | Debian   | `apt`           | Server, IoT, Desktop |
| **RedHat** | Fedora   | `dnf`           | Server               |
| Rocky      | RedHat   | `dnf`           | Server               |
| Arch       |          | `pacman`        | Desktop              |
| openSUSE   | SUSE     | `zypper`        | Server, Desktop      |

## Linux as a Server

To use Linux server, you need to know:
- [[SSH]]
- [[Common Linux Commands]]
- [[Linux Permissions]]

You may need to know:
- [bashrc vs bash_profile](https://www.notion.so/bashrc-vs-bash_profile-1568695f3ace8034acfce7751d49395f?pvs=21)
- [Bash Script](https://www.notion.so/Bash-Script-1568695f3ace80a5983ff208270523bb?pvs=21)
- [Symbolic Link](https://www.notion.so/Symbolic-Link-1458695f3ace805cb2eec63b2cbabf0f?pvs=21) (symlink)
